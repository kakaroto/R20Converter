# R20Converter

R20Converter is a python script that does the entire conversion from a Roll20 campaign (exported with [R20Exporter](https://github.com/kakaroto/R20Exporter)) into a [Foundry VTT](http://foundryvtt.com) world.

This tool is currently only available to my [Patreon subscribers](https://patreon.com/kakaroto).

This repository is used for keeping track of issues and feature requests.
